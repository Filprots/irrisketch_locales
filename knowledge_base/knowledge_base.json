    "question": "Transition to drawing mode takes a lot of time",
    "answer": "Usually, this is related to a very large number of elements in the project, as IRRISketch Residential is not designed for particularly large plots. This problem can be solved by deleting all existing objects in drawing mode and replacing them with a single background.\n\n1. Create a copy of the project and open it if you're afraid of accidentally losing data.\n2. Switch to irrigation mode and use the ctrl+a key combination to select all elements, then cut them using the ctrl+x key combination (they will be saved in the clipboard).\n3. Switch to drawing mode, set the \"Landscape\" setting in the \"Visual Style\" tab to obtain the original landscape of the project, and remove the stamp.\n4. Select a sheet format from A1 to A4. The larger the sheet size, the higher the quality of the final image, but the more space it will occupy.\n5. Use the \"Ruler\" tool in drawing mode to measure any easily measurable element of the drawing and record its length, as it will be needed later.\n6. Switch to \"Edit Drawing\" mode at the bottom of the screen and insert the drawing into the sheet using the button at the bottom left. Export the project as an image. If the resulting image is larger than 10MB, you won't be able to use it. In that case, if you know how to use various image editors (such as Photoshop, Gimp), compress the image or reduce the number of colors. This will reduce the file size.\n7. Insert the image into the project and set the correct scale using the length recorded in step 5.\n8. Align the image with your drawing so that all elements are in the same positions as they appear in the image.\n9. Lock the image by selecting it and clicking the corresponding button at the bottom left.\n10. Use the ctrl+a key combination to select all elements in drawing mode and delete them. Only your image should remain.\n11. Return to irrigation mode and paste all previously deleted irrigation elements back onto the drawing using the ctrl+v key combination. If done correctly, all elements should return to their original positions.",
